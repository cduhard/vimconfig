h1. Introduction

Many people copy and paste configuration files for Vim without really understanding what the options mean.
This is my attempt at assembling my own Vim configuration by stealing as much as I can from other people
but trying to add each new thing as a separate git commit. To see the pattern of my madness you can 
view the git log and you could also cherry pick the features you'd like to make your own config. 

h1. Setup

First backup any existing Vim configuration you might have:

<pre><code>
mv ~/.vim ~/vim_old 
mv ~/.vimrc ~/vimrc_old
mv ~/.gvimrc ~/gvimrc_old

git clone git://github.com/marcjeanson/vimconfig.git ~/.vim
</code></pre>

Note, I don't care about Windows sorry :)

h1. Credits

I've lifted some of the options from old config files I had as well as a few projects on the net.

This project was sparked up after reading "Akita's blog post:":http://www.akitaonrails.com/2009/1/4/rails-on-vim-in-english
